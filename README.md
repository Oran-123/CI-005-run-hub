## Agile Methodology

### Prioritisation 

After creating a comprehensive list of criteria, I carefully assessed each user story with regard to its alignment with the overarching project goals. I then employed GitHub Projects to assign priorities to these user stories through the use of labels.

To determine these priorities, I applied the MoSCoW prioritization technique, a widely-adopted practice in agile project management. This method aids in making informed choices regarding the precedence of requirements or features during the development process. The technique categorizes requirements into four distinct groups:

- <strong>Must Have (M)</strong>: These are indispensable features that are non-negotiable and must be incorporated into the current release. They serve as the core functionality and are vital for the project's success.

- <strong>Should Have (S)</strong>: These features, while significant for enhancing the product, are not as critical as the "Must Have" items. They are essential for the overall project success but may be postponed to a subsequent release if necessary.

- <strong>Could Have (C)</strong>: These features are desirable but their absence does not impede the core functionality. They represent potential improvements or nice-to-haves that can be considered for inclusion if time and resources permit.

- <strong>Won't Have (W)</strong>: These are features considered unnecessary within the current project scope. They are deliberately excluded from the development process due to factors such as time constraints, technical limitations, or low business value. In my project, I did not employ a specific label to denote "Won't Have" user stories. Instead, during each sprint, if a user story couldn't be completed, it was moved to a "descoped" status to signify its exclusion from the project's scope.

It's worth noting that in my project, some user stories labeled as "Must Have" were not completed. This occurred because certain epics related to these user stories were descoped due to capacity limitations.

### User Stories and Epics

## Branding

### Logo

The Run Hub logo features the brand name "RUNHUB" in blue, with the "H" subtly extending its descender to form a loop from which a pair of running shoes hangs by their laces. The running shoes are depicted in vibrant red. The logo design creates a sense of unity between the brand name and the symbol, conveying that Run Hub is where runners come together to explore their passion for running. The hanging running shoes represent choice, customization, and individuality, as runners can find the perfect fit for their needs at Run Hub.

The color combination of blue and red is carefully chosen to evoke trust and excitement. The blue of the brand name establishes reliability and professionalism, while the red of the running shoes communicates energy and passion. This combination reflects the brand's commitment to delivering top-quality products and services that ignite the enthusiasm of the running community.

-<strong>Torch Red</strong> The red color (#FF003D) symbolizes energy, passion, and action.

-<strong>Azure Radiance</strong> The blue color (#007BFF) represents trust, reliability, and professionalism. It's a calming and stable color that conveys the idea that Run Hub is a trustworthy and dependable source for running enthusiasts. Blue is also commonly associated with the sky and water, which aligns with the outdoor and nature-related aspects of running.

-<strong>White</strong> The white color (#FFFFFF) Creates a clean and simple canvas which will allow other elements such as the text, images and icons to stand out prominently.

- <strong>Raleway</strong>: The title font for Run Hub, epitomizes modern sophistication. Its clean and contemporary sans-serif design exudes professionalism and reliability, aligning perfectly with the brand's image. The font's elegance adds a touch of class, making it ideal for showcasing the brand's name and essential headings. Raleway's versatility ensures a consistent and visually pleasing identity that resonates with Run Hub's target audience.

Its neutral sans-serif design ensures a comfortable reading experience, enhancing the accessibility of the content. The font's friendliness and approachability create a welcoming atmosphere, which is crucial for engaging visitors. Open Sans balances readability and style perfectly, making it the ideal choice for Run Hub's user-friendly approach. It contributes to the brand's professional image while ensuring that information is easily digestible and captures the audience's attention.

### UX 

## Wireframes

I employed Balsamiq for crafting wireframes in my project. This user-friendly wireframing tool facilitates the rapid and effortless creation of mockups for websites and applications. It provides a diverse array of pre-designed UI elements and supports seamless collaboration with my team. I've attached a PNG of the wireframes for you to review the project's design, layout, and workflow before moving forward with actual product development.

### Structure

My website development approach will prioritize mobile devices, adopting a mobile-first mindset. To ensure optimal styling across different screen sizes, I will focus on the smallest screen size of the iPhone 5/SE (320px) and incorporate appropriate screen size breakpoints for responsive design.[Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap breakpoints").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
